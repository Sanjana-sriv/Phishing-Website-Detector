# üõ°Ô∏è Phishing Website Detection Tool

A smart and lightweight Python tool that helps users detect potentially harmful or phishing websites using a combination of **rule-based heuristics** and **machine learning (ML)**. This tool is designed to enhance cybersecurity awareness and prevent users from falling victim to phishing attacks.

## üîç Features

- ‚úÖ **Rule-Based Detection**: Uses URL structure, suspicious keywords, TLDs, and other heuristics to determine if a URL is likely phishing.
- ü§ñ **Machine Learning Support**: Trains a Random Forest classifier on sample URL datasets using text and numeric features.
- üí° **Risk Scoring**: Outputs a phishing risk score (0‚Äì100) and highlights patterns or anomalies.
- üß† **Combined Verdict**: Blends ML prediction with rule-based scoring for improved accuracy.
- üñ•Ô∏è **Dual Mode Support**: 
  - GUI using Tkinter *(for local use)*
  - CLI fallback *(for environments like Google Colab or terminals)*
- üìÅ **Self-contained**: Includes sample training data and works offline after setup.

## üß™ How It Works

### üîπ Rule-Based Detection

The rule-based engine evaluates URLs using logical checks to assign a phishing **risk score** out of 100 and generate warnings. It looks for:

-  **Excessive subdomains** (e.g., `login.verify.bank.example.com`)
-  **Use of IP addresses** instead of domain names (e.g., `http://192.168.0.1/login`)
-  **Suspicious keywords** in the URL such as `login`, `verify`, `account`, `bank`, `secure`, `paypal`, etc.
-  **Unusual top-level domains (TLDs)** like `.tk`, `.ga`, `.ml`, `.cf`, `.pp.ua`, etc. ‚Äî commonly used in phishing attacks
-  **Long or obfuscated URLs** (e.g., very long URLs or those with multiple parameters)
-  **Unicode homograph attacks** (e.g., URLs with visually similar but different characters ‚Äî Cyrillic `–∞`, `–µ`, etc.)
-  **Lack of HTTPS**
-  **URL shorteners** (e.g., `bit.ly`, `tinyurl.com`) which can hide destination domains

A risk score > 50 flags the URL as **phishing**.

### üîπ ML-Based Detection (Optional)

The ML model uses a **Random Forest Classifier** to predict whether a URL is phishing or legitimate based on both content and structure.

**Key aspects:**

- üìà **Character-level TF-IDF**:
  - Uses n-grams of 2 to 4 characters
  - Extracts textual patterns from URLs
- üî¢ **Numerical feature extraction**:
  - URL length, domain length, path/query lengths
  - Symbol counts: `.`, `-`, `_`, `@`, `=`, `?`, `&`, `%`, etc.
  - Boolean flags: Has IP, Has HTTPS, Has subdomain, etc.
- üß™ **Sample training dataset included**:
  - 10 legitimate and 10 phishing URLs
  - Easy to replace or expand with larger datasets
- üîÅ **Hybrid scoring**:
  - Combines rule-based risk with ML prediction for more accurate results

If trained, the ML model contributes a **weighted score (70%)** to the final decision, while rule-based scoring contributes **30%**.
