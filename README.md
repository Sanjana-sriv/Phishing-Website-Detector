# üõ°Ô∏è Phishing Website Detection Tool

A smart and lightweight Python tool that helps users detect potentially harmful or phishing websites using a combination of **rule-based heuristics** and **machine learning (ML)**. This tool is designed to enhance cybersecurity awareness and prevent users from falling victim to phishing attacks.

## üîç Features

- ‚úÖ **Rule-Based Detection**: Uses URL structure, suspicious keywords, TLDs, and other heuristics to determine if a URL is likely phishing.
- ü§ñ **Machine Learning Support**: Trains a Random Forest classifier on sample URL datasets using text and numeric features.
- üí° **Risk Scoring**: Outputs a phishing risk score (0‚Äì100) and highlights patterns or anomalies.
- üß† **Combined Verdict**: Blends ML prediction with rule-based scoring for improved accuracy.
- üñ•Ô∏è **Dual Mode Support**: 
  - GUI using Tkinter *(for local use)*
  - CLI fallback *(for environments like Google Colab or terminals)*
- üìÅ **Self-contained**: Includes sample training data and works offline after setup.
